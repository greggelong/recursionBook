# recursionBook

a place to put some code in javaScript and python

while going through Al Sweigart's book on recursion

The java script code will be in separate hmtm files called from links in the index

like an old school web site

you can reach the live site

[https://greggelong.github.io/recursionBook/](https://greggelong.github.io/recursionBook/)

--------

Firefox doesn't seem to like relative paths in the index html when hosted on GitHub pages.  

The but relative path will work for the local host.  So as I am coding 

and deploying at the same time I will use the whole path name.

however you must be careful as you will be viewing the deployed page linked in the index even when you are using your local host 

so go live on each page 


UPDATE

see the discussion

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16316311/github-pages-and-relative-paths

I tried using the setting a base url that worked to make the code a little cleaner

but the same problem with local host testing

****

but then I tried just waiting and that worked too

I just use relative links and after a few minutes I did not get the 404

error

GitHub pages just needs some time to update to modifications 

which is also discussed in the thread
